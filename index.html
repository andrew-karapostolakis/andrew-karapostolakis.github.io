						Hello! I am currently studying computer engineering at the University of
						Waterloo. The languages I'm most familiar with are Java and C++, although
						I know a bit of Arduino, Processing, Python, JavaScript, and HTML.
					</p>
					<p>
						I've worked at Bach-Simpson and NCR as a software intern, and they were both
						great fun, as well as being learning experiences!
					</p>

						Check out the links at the top if you want to see some of the work I've done.
